## Introduction

This guide acts as a repository for using Oracle Integration written by [Alex MacDonald](https://intro.alexmacdonald.solutions). You will find relevant resources for administering and using OIC with a wide variety of use cases.

Oracle Integration, OIC, is a fully managed service offered by Oracle, ranked as a [leader in application integration by Gartner](https://www.informatica.com/ipaas-magic-quadrant.html). OIC offers application integration, typically triggered by an enterprise's business events, and it can eliminate the pain points caused by [point-to-point integrations](https://www.christiernan.com/why-point-to-point-integrations-are-evil/). We have [many successful customers](https://blogs.oracle.com/integration/oracle-integration-customer-success-stories) that have digitally transformed their businesses. 

OIC substantially differs from Oracle's [ODI](https://garyhostt.github.io/Oracle_Data_Integrator/), [EDQ](https://www.oracle.com/webfolder/technetwork/tutorials/tutorial/edq/pdf/edq-12.2.1-getting-started-lab/getting-started-with-edq.pdf), and [GoldenGate](https://github.com/zzhangjii/GoldenGate2ADB) offerings. The latter 3 offer data integration - moving larger quantities of data, typically to a data warehouse, for analysis. **Newly released:** is Oracle's [Data Integration](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/data-integration/using/overview.htm).

- For Fusion application users seeking to move ***large*** quantities of data, click [here](https://garyhostt.github.io/Oracle_Data_Integrator/) to see how to use BICC, Object Storage, Oracle Data Integrator, and Autonomous Database in conjunction. 

If this is your first time hearing about OIC, check out the [OIC Product homepage](https://www.oracle.com/middleware/application-integration/). OIC can also complement [cloud native applications deployed on OCI](https://garyhostt.github.io/OCI_DevOps/).

If you do not have an OIC environment, you can start with this [tutorial](https://www.oracle.com/webfolder/s/assets/demo/integration-simulator/index.html#step1) that simulates an environment for you. You can follow [these instructions](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/paas/integration-cloud/integration-cloud-auton/create-oracle-integration-instance.html#GUID-EC63C933-34BF-4B13-94F7-E2979A1668DB) to spin up an instance. Once you have OIC spun up, start with these [beginner tutorials](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/paas/integration-cloud/tutorials.html) or the **'Beginner Workshops'** later in this repository.

## General resources

[The main OIC documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/paas/integration-cloud/index.html) is your friend.

Do I need the on-premises adapters, what is process automation, how much does it cost? Check out [OIC Pricing](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/integration/pricing.html) & [editions](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/integration/doc/oracle-integration-editions.html), it's based on how many 'messages' you consume. But what is a message and how do you count them? Check out this [explanation](https://blog.rubiconred.com/understanding-oracle-integration-cloud-licensing/).

- SaaS customers may be interested in the [Oracle Integration for Oracle SaaS edition](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/paas/integration-cloud/integration-cloud-auton/differences-oracle-integration-and-oracle-integration-oracle-saas.html), depending on their requirements.
  
Perhaps you want to programatically schedule OIC, or even have OIC integrate with itself? Then check out the OIC REST API documentation [here](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/paas/integration-cloud/rest-api/index.html) or [here](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/integration/index.html), depending on the task. What credentials do I need to connect, how do I configure SaaS outbound messaging, what can an adapter do? If these questions sound familiar, start with [the adapter documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/paas/integration-cloud/find-adapters.html).

The [Integration blog](https://blogs.oracle.com/integration/) is where new features for OIC are announced and very helpful articles. If you see a new feature you want to try - here's how you can [request a feature flag](https://blogs.oracle.com/integration/enabling-the-future-today-feature-flags-in-oracle-integration-cloud).

From the [marketplace](https://cloudmarketplace.oracle.com/marketplace/en_US/homeLinkPage) you can download pre-made integration recipes from here and customize them to your use case, such as [Netsuite to Jira case syncronization](https://cloudmarketplace.oracle.com/marketplace/en_US/adf.task-flow?tabName=O&adf.tfDoc=%2FWEB-INF%2Ftaskflow%2Fadhtf.xml&application_id=48917996&adf.tfId=adhtf) or this [salesforce & eloqua contact sync](https://cloudmarketplace.oracle.com/marketplace/en_US/listing/38627693). Need to start/stop your instance, scale for more message packs, or export your integrations? Check out how to [manage Oracle Integration](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/paas/integration-cloud/integration-cloud-auton/manage-oracle-integration.html).

## Basic types of integrations - with workshop examples

1. SaaS triggers
2. Scheduled
3. Generic REST trigger

There are more than these, but these have been the typical use case patterns I have seen.

### SaaS triggers

SaaS trigger integrations typically rely upon these factors:
  - Use of one of the SaaS adapters in trigger or trigger & invoke mode
  - Configuration on the SaaS to fire off an outbound message or a webhook to OIC
  - An event then occuring in the SaaS application that will trigger communication with OIC

Using Eloqua as a trigger first requires [installing this agent and linking it to your OIC environment](https://docs.oracle.com/cloud/latest/marketingcs_gs/OMCAA/Help/Apps/IntegrationCloudService/Tasks/InstallingICS.htm). After installing the agent, you then need to create the rule in Eloqua that triggers the outbound call to OIC by [adding a task to a campaign canvas](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/saas/marketing/eloqua-user/Help/Apps/IntegrationCloudService/Tasks/AddingICSToCanvas.htm).

[**This workshop**](https://github.com/GaryHostt/OIC_SaaS_integration) shows how to configure Fusion/Cloud ERP to perform outbound communication with OIC. In it, a product created in Product Data Hub triggers an integration to then add the data to CPQ. It will also get you started with Process Automation. The latter parts of [this workshop](https://garyhostt.github.io/beginner_ERP_OIC/) show more event based integrations and all of the necessary configuration inside ERP to configure for your event integrations.

This video shows you how to start [configuring salesforce for business events](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Pq-Dme5Gvc&feature=share) as integration triggers. This article explains [configuring Service Cloud outbound communication](https://redthunder.blog/2019/04/15/oracle-service-cloud-to-eloqua-contact-create-update-using-oic/) to Eloqua.

### Scheduled

Schedule integrations are good for sending data from applications to data warehouses, reading information from csv files, or pulling information from applications and writing that data to a csv file. 

[**This workshop**](https://github.com/GaryHostt/BigQueryIntegration) is an example of pulling info from an FTP server and writing them to Google's data warehouse, BigQuery, via its REST API. However, for files larger than that and less than 1 GB - you will need the 'stage file' operation in order to read the file - as shown in [this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hE5nF-henFw&feature=share). Besides reading files, you can [write them to an FTP after invoking data (seen in this video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wx-gAT4IdU), and [list files - even from multiple directories](https://www.techsupper.com/2019/05/how-to-list-files-from-ftp-resides-in-multiple-directories-oracle-integration-cloud.html). 

OIC can process flat files up to 1 GB in size. For larger files than that - [check out my data integration repo](https://github.com/GaryHostt/Oracle_Data_Integrator). [What if errors occur in my scheduled integration?](https://github.com/GaryHostt/Oracle_Integration/blob/master/Errors.md)

### Generic REST endpoint

The next use case pattern is basically using OIC as a 'drag & drop API builder'. You can use a blank REST adapter at the beginning of your integrations. This can also be used to abstract away SOAP endpoints. These endpoints can also invoked from Postman, SOAP UI, VBCS, your given front end framework of choice, coding language API call, etc. 

[**In this workshop**](https://garyhostt.github.io/ATPworkshop/), we basically use OIC to create a REST API for an Autonomous Transaction Processing database. [Click here](http://media.licdn.com/embeds/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2F-9nP2LaeOok%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D-9nP2LaeOok&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube) for a video explanation by a colleague & I. It will also show you how to get started using VBCS.

The generic REST trigger can also be used to create SaaS trigger integrations with [webhooks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUaDIH5ZXB8). Applications need to be configurable to send payloads to a generic REST endpoint. For example, Agile PLM, an Oracle application lacking its own adapter, can be configured to make an outbound call to a generic API as a result of event updates. To create asynchronous communication, you can choose not to configure the REST adapter to receive a response from your other systems.

The generic REST endpoint can also be the beginning of creating an omni-channel communication device, like [Wuphf](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT6uWYqJq6E)! It can also be used to [receive information from an OCI event](https://redthunder.blog/2020/05/14/triggering-an-oic-integration-via-oci-events-the-oracle-functions-approach/).

The first half of [this repository](https://garyhostt.github.io/beginner_ERP_OIC/) does a deep dive on using the generic REST endpoint with Cloud ERP.

## Treatise: developing in OIC, [my own](https://www.linkedin.com/in/robertamacdonald94/) views

### Mapping 
I want to explain how to go about developing for an integration, such as is in [**this lab**](https://github.com/GaryHostt/Fusion_PurchaseOrder_Integration). How does one know what fields to have in the mapper when you have a generic endpoint going to a SaaS API?

When trying to invoke a SaaS endpoint - perhaps with a generic REST trigger, you may find that you are inundated with hundreds of fields in the mapper you do not know. Typically, beginning by searching [the documentation is a good start](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/saas/procurement/19a/oaprc/manage-purchase-orders.html#OAPRC1007407). Looking at the 'Defaults:' we can find the fields required for the lines, schedules, and distributions. If you are calling a SOAP API and simply want to abstract it away as a REST API - simply make the request payload have the same fields that the SOAP API has and then press the recommend button - it should work for the fields if they are about a 1:1 ratio and have identical names.

Then, to understand the data types for the fields - or see how they're formatted, I'd call the endpoint to give me one or all of the given business object I'm trying to create. In this case, I can look at the [get all POs or get 1 PO endpoints](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/saas/procurement/19d/fapra/api-purchase-orders.html). The responses from calling the API directly show me how it expects values to be for the given fields. I can then use this information when sending in field/value pairs in the request payload.

Typically for development purposes, I would start this integration with a generic REST adapter that has ~5 fields that map to important fields for the SaaS. After filling out the important ones like POHeaderID, ItemNumber, etc. I activate the integration, then send a payload. Typically, the response will be a 500 error and the response will then contain the field that still requires an attribute. Next, deactivate the integration, map another field from the REST adapter to the business field and then from Postman you can dynamically try different values for that field. Once you find a working value - you can leave it in the submission to the generic REST adapter, or just hardcode it in the adapter. 

### If your integration is not appearing in tracking after performing the trigger action in SaaS

If you create a contact in Fusion, or a new lead in salesforce, but the business event isn't appearing in tracking - you need to verify that you properly configured the SaaS. You should also check if you are logged in as the user on the SaaS that you used to create the connection on OIC.

### Learning OIC as a business user

Before working with Oracle Integration, my previous technical experience mainly revolved around data work. When I started working at Oracle and with OIC, I began interacting with APIs more. Learning API development via OIC as my primary medium enabled me to learn how to use APIs faster rather than via minutiae of coding. Any user of OIC will have to read API documentation for the application with which they want to integrate, but if you are a business user that does not want to code - OIC can become your greatest tool for interacting with APIs and automating your business processes. 

*If you are a business user that is trying out OIC and doesn't know where to start, proceed to the 'Beginner Workshops' section below, and in no time you'll be accelerating your time to market.*

      ---> The agent is required to integrate with systems not accessible from the internet. Agent does not listen on any ports and communicates outbound on port 443. The network must allow egress to OIC instance port 443.The agent ensures your on-premises systems can live in harmony with the cloud. If you are having issues, [check this page for solutions](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/paas/integration-cloud/integrations-user/troubleshooting-premises-connectivity-agent-issues.html); ex: when configuring - do not use an IDCS federated account!

## Advanced use cases

### Embeding VBCS & Process forms 

Being able to embed VBCS & Process forms is a powerful feature - imagine a company is doing a Lift and Shift of EBS to Cloud ERP over the course of 6 months. As they move different modules, new business users can interact with forms embedded in Cloud ERP that are actually integrated to call endpoints in EBS. This means that EBS is integrated with ERP - without even being noticed. This effectively places the functionality of the non-migrated parts of EBS inside of Cloud ERP.

- Example: When a new user is created somewhere - they can then be created in IDCS.

[Calling a serverless function with the REST adapter](https://github.com/GaryHostt/OCI_DevOps/blob/master/304.md)

[Object Storage with OIC](https://redthunder.blog/2020/01/13/object-storage-with-oracle-integration-cloud-part-1/)

- In order to call the OCI REST API, like above, - you have to configure the REST adapter connection to use the [OCI Signature Version 1 security policy](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/paas/integration-cloud/whats-new/index.html#INTWN-GUID-39D35E54-3FA5-4A44-A6FB-7C6496ED7E84). This policy enables you to use Oracle Cloud Infrastructure services. For example, you can create an integration that lists your VCNs. 

An event that occurs in OCI could also be fired to an [integration REST endpoint](https://github.com/GaryHostt/OCI_DevOps/blob/master/Lab100.md).

## Administering OIC

[The comprhensive guide on promoting your code from dev, test, prod and other other OIC environments to each other](https://blogs.oracle.com/integration/promoting-your-code)

Click [here to learn about managing OIC from the OCI console](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/integration/index.html), rather than platform services, and click here to learn about using the [new API for OIC](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/api/#/en/integration/20190131/). The API documentation can be used create new instances, change the compartment where OIC is located in OIC, and more.

To control and monitor costs, you can [create budgets and budget alerts in OCI](https://blogs.oracle.com/cloud-infrastructure/how-to-get-control-of-your-spending-in-oracle-cloud-infrastructure) and use the [start/stop API, which I demonstrate in this repo](https://garyhostt.github.io/OIC_start-stop/).

CI/CD for OIC is an improvement to just using the import/export feature, shown in this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FiC7PfN7wZ0) and this [article](https://redthunder.blog/2017/02/26/teaching-how-to-use-developer-cloud-service-to-promote-ics-integrations-into-new-environments/).
